# Naming things @HOVER

## Guidelines
### Use literal and unambiguous names
Instead of naming your application like a metal band, use a name that indicates what the applications purpose is.

### The repo name equals the application name
Period.

### Suffixes as a convention
Apply meaningful suffixes to your application if appropriate. For example and application that acts soly as an API, it should have the suffix `-api`.

Examples:
* `-api`: for API-only applications
* `-service`: for more generic services that are more than a simple API
* `-frontend`: for frontend applications
* `-client`: for API clients

### Rename things
If the purpose of an application changes over time, don't hesitate to rename it.

## Keep it simple
Only use `[a-zA-Z0-9]` and `-` as characters for your application name.

We want to use the project/application name as part of the domain name for a running instance of the application. Certain characters like `_` are not a valid in domain- and host-names.
